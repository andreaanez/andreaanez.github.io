## 2020 Summer Internship 


As an intern with Northrop Grumman I supported a Dev-ops team that created and managed platforms used to build documents. During my ten weeks with the team I was responsible for building a new platform which utilized continuous integration platforms [Docker](https://www.docker.com/why-docker), Kubernetes, Argocd and Jenkins. The new platform was not only many times faster than the original, which utilized Team City, but also much more cost effective since the aforementioned platforms where all open source.

## [2018 Start Up - "Moresolar"](https://medium.com/@moresolarllc) 

During my freshman year at UCSB I had the opportunity create a team of students centered around the goal of developing a simple device that would increase the efficiency of solar panels. This team
eventually evolved into the company “Moresolar.” After winning the [UCSB New Venture Competition](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4r0d9u37r0) (watch my pitch at 17:10) our company went on join the UCSB G2 Summer Incubator. As a co-founder my responsibilities included managing our technical team composed of interns [Haixu Yin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/haixu-yin-b03126b2/) and [Syaza Mustafah](https://www.linkedin.com/in/syazamustafah/) as well as drafting the provisional patent. By the end of the summer our technical team had successfully developed a working prototype and gathered rigorous performance data that ultimately earned Moresolar additional seed funding of $75,000 from angel investors.
