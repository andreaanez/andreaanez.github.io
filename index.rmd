# Hi, I'm Andrea Anez.

I'm a computer engineering major at UCSB and a member of the women's track and cross country teams. 
My academic focus is on machine learning and data science and I have included some of my favorite projects on this website. 
This summer I completed my first internship with Northrop Grumman as a Dev-ops engineer setting up a continuous delivery system through Argocd, Kubernetes and Jenkins.
When I'm not working I like to spend time at the beach and I have recently learned to surf.
